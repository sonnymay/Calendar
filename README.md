# Calendar

Calendar is a web-based application that allows users to view and manage events on a monthly calendar. The application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Demo

Check out the live demo of the application at https://sonnymay.github.io/Calendar/.

Features

Interactive monthly calendar with clickable dates and events
Customizable options for event color and date range
Add, edit, and delete events with a simple form interface
Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
Data persistence using the browser's local storage API

Usage

To use the application, simply open the index.html file in a modern web browser that supports JavaScript and the React library. The application has been tested and works well in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

Once the application is loaded, you can click on a date on the calendar to view any events that are scheduled for that day. You can also use the "Add Event" button to create a new event or click on an existing event to edit or delete it.

Development

If you want to modify or extend the application, you can download or clone the source code from the GitHub repository at https://github.com/sonnymay/Calendar.

The application is built using React, so you will need to have a basic understanding of React development to work on the code. To build the application, you will need a web development environment with Node.js and npm installed.

To run the application locally, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following commands:


npm install
npm start

This will start a local development server and open the application in your default web browser.

Calendar was created by Sunny May as a personal project to learn more about React development and data persistence using the browser's local storage API. The project was inspired by similar calendar applications such as Google Calendar and Apple Calendar.
